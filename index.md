## Welcome to Yurong Chen' Homepage 陈煜嵘

#### I am now a Ph.D Student at the National Engineering Lab  of Hunan University led by Prof. Yaonan Wang and Prof. Hui Zhang. My research interests include image processing, probabilistic machine learning.

Previously, I graduated with a M.S. degree in ECE from the University of Pittsburgh (UPitt) in 2020.
